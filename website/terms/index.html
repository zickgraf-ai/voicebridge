        <p>By using TapToSpeak, you agree to these terms.</p>

        <h2>What TapToSpeak Is</h2>
        <p>TapToSpeak is a text-to-speech communication tool designed to help patients who are temporarily unable to speak. It converts typed or selected text into spoken audio using premium AI voices (via OpenAI) or your device's built-in speech engine (Web Speech API).</p>

        <h2>What TapToSpeak Is Not</h2>
        <p>TapToSpeak is not a medical device. It is not a substitute for professional medical care, clinical communication systems, or emergency services. TapToSpeak does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, contact emergency services immediately.</p>
        <p>The pre-loaded phrases in TapToSpeak are provided for convenience only and should not be relied upon as the sole means of communicating critical medical information to healthcare providers.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>TapToSpeak uses third-party AI services to provide premium features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> &mdash; for premium text-to-speech voice generation. The text you speak is sent to OpenAI's API when using premium voices.</li>
          <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> &mdash; for smart phrase suggestions. Contextual information (time of day, location label, recent phrases, medical condition, medications, family member names) is sent to Anthropic's Claude API.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your use of these features is also subject to the terms and privacy policies of these third-party providers.</p>

        <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your personal data (profile, settings, communication history) is stored locally on your device. Data is sent to third-party services only when you actively use premium voice or smart suggestion features. TapToSpeak does not use analytics or tracking. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

        <h2>Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
        <p>TapToSpeak is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or suitable for any particular medical or clinical purpose. You use TapToSpeak at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>TapToSpeak and its content, features, and functionality are owned by TapToSpeak Inc. and are protected by United States and international intellectual property laws.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, TapToSpeak Inc. shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, personal injury, or damages arising from the use or inability to use the app in a medical or clinical setting.</p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. The updated version will be posted at taptospeak.app/terms with a revised date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
