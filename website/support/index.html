        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I use TapToSpeak?</h3>
          <p>Tap any of the pre-loaded phrase buttons to speak common messages instantly. You can also tap the speech bar at the top to type a custom message, then tap to speak it aloud through your device's speaker.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What devices does TapToSpeak work on?</h3>
          <p>TapToSpeak is a web app (PWA) that works on any device with a modern browser &mdash; iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets, and desktop computers. For the best experience, add it to your home screen: in Safari, tap the Share button and select &ldquo;Add to Home Screen.&rdquo; In Chrome, tap the menu and select &ldquo;Install app.&rdquo;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does TapToSpeak work without internet?</h3>
          <p>Yes, after the initial load. TapToSpeak is a PWA that caches itself for offline use. When offline, it uses your device's built-in speech engine (Web Speech API) to speak phrases. Premium AI voices and smart suggestions require an internet connection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I change the voice or speaking speed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Open the Settings screen within the app (tap the gear icon in the bottom navigation). You can choose from available voices, adjust the speaking speed (Slow, Normal, or Fast), and configure other preferences like button size and category tab size.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are premium voices?</h3>
          <p>TapToSpeak offers high-quality AI voices powered by OpenAI in addition to your device's built-in voices. Premium voices require an internet connection for the first time a phrase is spoken, but the audio is cached on your device for instant playback on subsequent taps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does TapToSpeak collect my data?</h3>
          <p>Your personal data (profile, settings, history) is stored only on your device. When you use premium voices, the text you speak is sent to OpenAI's API to generate audio. When smart suggestions are active, contextual information is sent to Anthropic's API. No analytics or tracking is used. See our full <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is TapToSpeak free?</h3>
          <p>Yes. TapToSpeak is free with no ads, no in-app purchases, and no subscription.</p>
        </div>
